 * Introduction
This module provides a basic set of divs to wrap fields together, which stops fieldgroups being misused for themeing logic which is bad practice for god accessibility and general all round bad practice.
 
* Requirements
Webform

 * Installation
Download and enable webform_fieldwrapper

 * Configuration
In any webform, a new component called Field Wrapper is available, with a simple title. Once a field wrapper is added fields can be grouped under it. This component will then wrap  all fields in a DIV which can then be used to target CSS and/or other conditional field actions.
